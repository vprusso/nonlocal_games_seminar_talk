# Nonlocal Game Seminar Talk
## Version 0.0.1 - 1 July 2016

Supplemental MATLAB scripts for the nonlocal games seminar talk on monogamy-of-entanglement games.

## Dependencies

1. [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) (free if UW student check IST Software Portal),
2. [CVX](http://cvxr.com/cvx/download/) (free MATLAB package),
3. [QETLAB](http://www.qetlab.com/Main_Page) (free MATLAB package).
4. The software on this page. 

In order to run, place the QETLAB, CVX, and NLGST folders in your MATLAB working directory.

## Description

This set of scripts makes heavy use of the QETLAB package to study nonlocal games, and more specifically, 
the class of monogamy-of-entanglement games as is the focus of this talk / software.
